## Notes

***

### Git Hooks
- Git hooks have been added in the local repository accompanied with a script titled `pull_latest_changes.sh` which:
    - Pulls the latest changes in the local machines' file structure and auto-adds them inside the repository as needed.
- One git hook auto-runs this scrcipt as a `pre-commit`
- Another script executes `pacman -Q > Packages` as a `post-commit` to get the list of the latest packages installed.


### Directories

- `etc` directory corresponds to the contents inside the `/etc` directory locally.
- `bin` directory correspondes to `$HOME/bin`
- `.configs` directory correspondes to `$HOME/.config`


## Download and installation

- My set up is configured for three monitors. If you only use one monitor, or your laptops monitor, use you can modify the **bspwmrc** accordingly.

``` shell
bspc monitor $YOUR_MONITOR -d  1 2 3 4 5
```

and removing the lines that execute `DualMonitorSetUp.sh` (all that is included in the if statement)

i.e.

```shell
#
# Dual monitor setup
#
if [ -x $HOME/bin/DualMonitorSetUp.sh ];then
        bash $HOME/bin/DualMonitorSetUp.sh DVI-I-1-1 DVI-I-2-2
    .
    .
    .
fi
```

- TODO: Update with smarter auto-install script.
- Execute the following commands to have a basis of the configuration files for installation. 
- ** NOTE: Use these commands at your own risk. `cp -r` can be destructive to your system **
- ** These commands were not tested prior to being written **

```shell
# Make correct directories and import git repository
mkdir -p ~/.config && mkdir -p $HOME/bin && git clone https://github.com/andreleblanc11/BSPWM-dotfiles.git

# Copy files to system
cd BSPWM-dotfiles && cp -r configs/* ~/.config/ && cp -r etc/* /etc/ && cp -r bin/* $HOME/bin/

# Copy wallpapers
mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Wallpapers && cp -r Wallpapers/* ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/

# Copy bash/Xorg files
cp xinitrc ~/.xinitrc && cp .bashrc ~/.bashrc && cp .bash_profile ~/.bash_profile

# Install packages

pacman -Syu $(cat $CHERRY_PICKED_PACKAGES_IN_FILE)
```
